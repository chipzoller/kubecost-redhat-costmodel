The Software may include third party software components that are subject to open source and/or pass-through commercial licenses and/or notices (such third party programs, "Third Party Software" and "Third Party Software Terms and Notices", respectively). Some of the Third Party Software Terms and Notices may be made available to Customer in the Software, its Documentation or via a supplementary list provided by Stackwatch. Any covenants, representations, warranties, indemnities and other commitments with respect to the Software in this Agreement are made by Stackwatch and not by any authors, licensors, or suppliers of, or contributors to, such Third Party Software.

Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, each party agrees that all code, inventions, know-how and business, technical and financial information disclosed to such party ("Receiving Party") by the disclosing party ("Disclosing Party") constitute the confidential property of the Disclosing Party ("Confidential Information"), provided that it is identified as confidential at the time of disclosure or should be reasonably known by the Receiving Party to be confidential or proprietary due to the nature of the information disclosed and the circumstances surrounding the disclosure. Any Stackwatch Technology and any performance information relating to the Software will be deemed Confidential Information of Stackwatch without any marking or further designation. Except as expressly authorized herein, the Receiving Party will (1) hold in confidence and not disclose any Confidential Information to third parties and (2) not use Confidential Information for any purpose other than fulfilling its obligations and exercising its rights under this Agreement. The Receiving Party may disclose Confidential Information to its employees, agents, contractors and other representatives having a legitimate need to know, provided that they are bound to confidentiality obligations no less protective of the Disclosing Party than this Section 5 and that the Receiving Party remains responsible for compliance by them with the terms of this Section 5.

The Receiving Party acknowledges that disclosure of Confidential Information would cause substantial harm for which damages alone would not be a sufficient remedy, and therefore that upon any such disclosure by the Receiving Party the Disclosing Party will be entitled to appropriate equitable relief in addition to whatever other remedies it might have at law.
